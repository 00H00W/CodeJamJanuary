Long-Term Survival: Preparing for Extended Emergencies
When preparing for emergencies, it's crucial to consider how a disaster might affect your individual needs. Plan to be self-sufficient for up to two weeks.
 Here are some tips for long-term survival:
1.	Build a comprehensive emergency supply kit: Include enough water, non-perishable food, and other essentials to last at least three days, preferably longer. Your kit should contain:
•	Water (one gallon per person per day)
•	Non-perishable food
•	Battery-powered radio and flashlight with extra batteries
•	First aid supplies
•	Change of clothing and blankets
•	Basic tools (wrench, pliers, can opener)
•	Dust masks, plastic sheeting, and duct tape
•	Personal hygiene items
•	Important documents in a waterproof container
2.	Consider special circumstances:
•	If pregnant, know where to access prenatal care during an emergency.
•	For those with disabilities or caregivers, stock extra medications, medical equipment, and alternative communication methods.
•	Seniors should plan for transportation and access to essential services. 
3.	Don't forget your pets: Have a list of pet-friendly hotels/motels and animal shelters along your evacuation routes. Remember, if it's not safe for you, it's not safe for your pets either. 
4.	Stay calm and adaptable:
•	Try not to panic in emergency situations.
•	Know your limits and be realistic about what you can handle.
•	Be prepared to modify your plans as circumstances change.
•	Learn to do more with less and keep your approach simple. 
By following these guidelines and regularly updating your emergency plans and supplies, you'll be better prepared to face extended emergency situations.
