Evacuation Essentials: What to Do When Disaster Strikes|When evacuation becomes necessary, follow these critical steps:
1.	Keep your car's gas tank full if evacuation seems likely.
2.	Plan to use one car per family to reduce traffic congestion.
3.	Gather your disaster supplies kit.
4.	Arrange transportation with friends or local authorities if you don't have a car.
5.	Wear sturdy shoes and protective clothing.
6.	Stay informed by listening to a battery-powered radio for evacuation instructions. 
Before leaving your home:
1.	Close and lock all doors and windows.
2.	Unplug electrical equipment, except for freezers and refrigerators (unless there's a flood risk).
3.	Inform others of your destination.
4.	Leave early to avoid being trapped by severe weather.
5.	Follow recommended evacuation routes and avoid shortcuts.
6.	Be alert for hazards like washed-out roads and bridges.
7.	Don't drive into flooded areas.
8.	Stay clear of downed power lines.
Ensure your emergency kit is ready to go. It should include water, food, a battery-powered radio, flashlight with extra batteries, first aid supplies, clothing, blankets, tools, a whistle, dust masks, plastic sheeting, duct tape, garbage bags, a map, and any special items for infants, elderly, or disabled family members. Keep these supplies in an easily transportable container like a covered trash bin, large backpack, or duffel bag. By following these guidelines, you'll be better prepared to evacuate safely when disaster strikes.
