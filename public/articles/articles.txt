Essential Emergency Preparedness: Creating Your Disaster Plan
When severe weather or disasters strike without warning, having a solid emergency plan can make all the difference. 
Creating an annual disaster preparedness plan is crucial for ensuring your family's safety.
To get started: 
1.  Develop an evacuation route plan that includes scenarios where family members are separated.
2.	Build an emergency kit with enough food, water, medicines, and supplies to last several days.
3.	Don't forget to include provisions for pets in your emergency planning. 
Staying connected during emergencies is vital. Consider these communication strategies:
•	Download emergency alert apps like those from FEMA and the Red Cross.
•	Sign up for email alerts from local authorities and the CDC.
•	Keep a battery-powered radio on hand in case of power outages. 
To protect your home and finances:
•	Secure loose items around your property and trim overhanging tree limbs.
•	Consider flood insurance if you live in a flood-prone area.
•	Make copies of important documents and add them to your emergency kit.
•	Set up electronic payments for benefits to avoid mail service disruptions. 
Remember, preparation is key to surviving and recovering from disasters.
