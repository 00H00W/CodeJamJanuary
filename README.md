# Intro

Sh3ltr is a project to help disaster victims locate shelter when disaster happens. It was made with simple user accessability and useability in mind. The site displays the power of React + Vite, CSS and Google API's. All the elements display correctly on popular screen sizes using css grid, very minimal media queries and React. Enjoy.

# Tech Used

We used minimal media queries as mostly the responsive design is made with css display flex, React + Vite and Google places and goecoding API. Using React + Vite helps site load faster using less Bandwith, server strain and mobile performance were all taken into account when designing the site.

# Description and Functionality

Sh3ltr is a site of resources for shelter when disasters happen. Using the Google API's people can search for shelter in their city a time of need. The site is designed to function on any browser- mobile or desktop. Plans to improve the project includes adding additional resources (food, pet support etc), news, map pins, community postings.

To run site locally:

1. Open terminal and create a folder for project. Change directory to that folder.
2. Type git clone https://github.com/00H00W/CodeJamJanuary
3. Type npm install, this will create node_modules folder and package-lock.json file.
4. Type npm run dev and it will start the React development server locally on port 3000.
