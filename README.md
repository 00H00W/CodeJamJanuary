# Sh3ltr

Sh3ltr is a project to help disaster victims locate shelter when disaster happens. It was made with simple user accessability and useability in mind. The site displays the power of React + Vite, CSS and API's. All the elements displayed correctly on popular screen sizes using css grid, very minimal media queries and React. Enjoy.

## Tech Used

This project was fun and challenging. We used minimal media queries as mostly the responsive design is made with css display grid and React + Vite. Using React + Vite helps site load faster using less Bandwith, server strain and mobile performance are all taken into account when designing the site.

## Description and Functionality

Sh3ltr is a site of resource for shelter and news when disasters happen. Using the FEMA API people can locate shelter in a time of need. The site is designed to function on any browser- mobile or desktop. No need to install special extensions. Plans to improve the project includes adding additional resources (food, pet support, parking, etc), community postings.
